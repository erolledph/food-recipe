# Classic Beef Tacos with Homemade Salsa

There's nothing quite like a homemade beef taco topped with fresh salsa. These authentic-style tacos come together in just 20 minutes and are a guaranteed crowd-pleaser for family dinner.

## Ingredients

### For the Beef Tacos
- 1 lb ground beef
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/2 cup beef broth
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 8-12 taco shells or corn tortillas

### For the Salsa
- 2 medium tomatoes, diced
- 1/2 red onion, finely diced
- 1 jalapeño, minced (remove seeds for less heat)
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 lime, juiced
- Salt to taste

### For Serving
- Shredded lettuce
- Shredded cheese
- Sour cream
- Avocado slices
- Radishes, sliced
- Additional cilantro

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Salsa
In a bowl, combine diced tomatoes, red onion, minced jalapeño, cilantro, and lime juice.

Season with salt to taste. Set aside to let flavors meld.

### Step 2: Brown the Beef
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Add ground beef and cook, breaking it apart with a spoon, for 5-7 minutes until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary.

### Step 3: Sauté Aromatics
Add diced onion and cook for 3 minutes until softened.

Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

### Step 4: Add Spices
Stir in chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne, and oregano. Cook for 1 minute to toast the spices and enhance their flavors.

### Step 5: Add Liquids
Add tomato paste and stir to coat the meat. Cook for 1 minute.

Pour in beef broth and stir well. Bring to a simmer.

### Step 6: Simmer
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened and flavors have developed.

Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.

### Step 7: Warm Shells
If using taco shells, warm them in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes. If using tortillas, warm them directly over a gas flame for 30 seconds per side, or wrap in foil and warm in the oven.

### Step 8: Assemble Tacos
Fill each taco shell or tortilla with beef mixture.

Top with shredded lettuce, cheese, salsa, sour cream, avocado, and radishes.

### Step 9: Serve
Serve immediately with extra salsa and lime wedges on the side.

## Customization Ideas

### Protein Options
- Ground turkey for a lighter version
- Shredded chicken for a milder flavor
- Chorizo for extra spice

### Salsa Variations
- **Corn Salsa**: Add corn kernels and black beans
- **Pico de Gallo**: Skip onion for a chunkier version
- **Salsa Verde**: Use green tomatoes and tomatillos
- **Roasted Salsa**: Roast tomatoes and peppers for deeper flavor

### Taco Bar Style
Set out all ingredients separately and let everyone build their own tacos with their favorite toppings.

## Tips for Perfect Tacos

- **Season Properly**: Don't be shy with the spices - that's what makes great tacos
- **Fresh Ingredients**: The fresher your toppings, the better your tacos will be
- **Warm Shells**: Cold shells are disappointing - always warm them
- **Don't Overfill**: Fill generously but not so much that everything falls apart
- **Fresh Salsa**: Make salsa just before serving for maximum flavor

## Make-Ahead Options

- **Seasoning Mix**: Combine spices in advance in a small container
- **Salsa**: Make early in the day - it actually improves as it sits
- **Beef Mixture**: Cook and keep warm in a slow cooker for easy serving
- **Toppings**: Chop and arrange on a platter an hour before serving

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve with cilantro-lime rice and refried beans
- Pair with cold Mexican lager or margaritas
- Add a side of chips and guacamole
- Follow with flan or churros for dessert
