# Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

There's nothing quite like a warm, homemade chocolate chip cookie fresh from the oven. These classic cookies combine buttery dough with generous amounts of chocolate chips, creating the perfect balance of chewy centers and crispy edges.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Preheat and Prepare
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients
In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

### Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars
In a large bowl, beat softened butter and both sugars until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes).

### Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla
Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.

### Step 5: Combine Ingredients
Gradually stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Don't overmix.

### Step 6: Add Chocolate and Nuts
Fold in chocolate chips and nuts if using. Stir until evenly distributed.

### Step 7: Bake
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake for 9-12 minutes, until golden brown. The centers may look slightly underdone - that's perfect!

### Step 8: Cool
Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Soft and Chewy**: Use butter at room temperature and don't overbake
- **Crispy Edges**: Bake a bit longer and use a mix of white and brown sugar
- **Extra Flavor**: Add a pinch of cinnamon or sea salt on top before baking
- **Make Ahead**: Scoop dough into balls and freeze - bake straight from frozen, adding 1-2 minutes to baking time

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve warm with cold milk
- Pack in lunchboxes for a special treat
- Gift in a decorated tin as a homemade present
- Crumble and layer with ice cream for a cookie sundae
