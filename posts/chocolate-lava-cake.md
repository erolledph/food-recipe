# Chocolate Lava Cake

This show-stopping dessert features a delicate cake exterior with a warm, gooey chocolate center that oozes out when you cut into it. It's elegant enough for a restaurant but simple enough to make at home in just 20 minutes.

## Ingredients

- 4 oz dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa), chopped
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Butter and cocoa powder for ramekins
- Powdered sugar for dusting
- Vanilla ice cream for serving (optional)
- Fresh berries for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Ramekins
Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

Brush two 6-oz ramekins with melted butter, making sure to coat the bottom and sides completely.

Dust the inside with cocoa powder, tapping out any excess. Set aside.

### Step 2: Melt Chocolate and Butter
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine chopped chocolate and butter.

Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until completely melted and smooth. Be careful not to scorch the chocolate.

Alternatively, melt in a double boiler over simmering water.

### Step 3: Mix Wet Ingredients
In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and sugar until pale and slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.

This helps create a light, airy cake.

### Step 4: Combine
Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until just combined.

Don't overmix - a few small streaks of unmixed batter are fine.

### Step 5: Add Dry Ingredients
Gently fold in flour and salt until just incorporated. Again, be gentle to maintain airiness.

### Step 6: Fill Ramekins
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared ramekins, filling them about three-quarters full.

The batter should look thick and glossy.

### Step 7: Bake
Place the ramekins on a baking sheet. Bake for 12-14 minutes until the edges are set but the center still jigles slightly when gently shaken.

The cake should pull away from the sides of the ramekin but the center should feel soft.

### Step 8: Rest and Unmold
Let cool for 1 minute. This is important - it helps the cake release from the ramekin.

Run a thin knife around the inside edge of each ramekin to loosen the cake.

### Step 9: Plate
Place a serving plate over the ramekin and carefully invert, holding firmly as you flip.

Give it a quick shake and the cake should slide out onto the plate.

### Step 10: Garnish and Serve
Dust with powdered sugar. If desired, place a scoop of vanilla ice cream next to the cake and a few fresh berries on top.

Serve immediately while the chocolate center is still warm and gooey.

## Tips for Perfect Lava Cake

- **Chocolate Quality**: Use good quality chocolate for the best flavor
- **Baking Time is Critical**: The difference between perfect and overcooked is just 1-2 minutes
- **Room Temperature Eggs**: They mix more easily and create a lighter cake
- **Don't Overmix**: This breaks down the air bubbles and results in a dense cake
- **Ramekin Prep**: Thorough buttering and cocoa powder coating prevents sticking

## Timing Tips

- **Prepare Ahead**: Mix the batter up to 4 hours in advance
- **Refrigerate**: Store unbaked cakes in the refrigerator, then add 2-3 minutes to baking time
- **Bake to Order**: For best results, bake just before serving

## Troubleshooting

- **No Molten Center**: Baked too long - reduce baking time by 1 minute
- **Completely Raw Inside**: Baked too little - add another minute, but watch carefully
- **Stuck in Ramekin**: Not buttered/dusted well enough; let cool 2 minutes and try again
- **Overflowed**: Too much batter; fill ramekins only three-quarters full

## Serving Variations

- **Vanilla Ice Cream**: The classic - the cold contrasts beautifully with the warm cake
- **Vanilla Sauce**: Serve with a simple vanilla bean sauce
- **Raspberry Coulis**: Top with tart raspberry sauce
- **Whipped Cream**: Add a dollop of freshly whipped cream
- **À la Carte**: Keep it simple with just powdered sugar

## Make-Ahead Notes

- **Batter**: Prepare up to 4 hours ahead and refrigerate
- **Storage**: Not ideal for storage - best served immediately after baking
- **Freezer**: Unbaked cakes can be frozen for up to 2 weeks

**Serves:** 2  
**Prep Time:** 10 minutes  
**Bake Time:** 12-14 minutes
