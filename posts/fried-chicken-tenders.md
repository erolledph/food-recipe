# Crispy Fried Chicken Tenders

These homemade fried chicken tenders are crunchy on the outside and impossibly juicy on the inside. With a simple seasoned flour coating and a few pro tips, you'll create restaurant-quality chicken that's far superior to any takeout version.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 tablespoon hot sauce (optional)
- 2 teaspoons salt

### For the Coating
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Oil for frying (vegetable or canola oil)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Chicken
Cut chicken breasts lengthwise into tenders about 1 inch wide.

### Step 2: Brine the Chicken
In a bowl, combine buttermilk, hot sauce (if using), and salt. Add chicken tenders and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours. This keeps the chicken incredibly juicy.

### Step 3: Prepare the Coating
In a shallow dish, mix flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, black pepper, and salt. The cornstarch is the secret to extra crispiness!

### Step 4: Heat the Oil
Pour oil into a large skillet or deep pan to about 1/2 inch depth. Heat to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer for accuracy.

### Step 5: Coat the Chicken
Remove chicken tenders from buttermilk one at a time, letting excess drip off. Roll in the seasoned flour mixture, coating all sides. Set aside on a plate.

### Step 6: Fry the Chicken
Carefully place coated tenders into the hot oil in batches - don't overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature 165°F).

### Step 7: Drain
Transfer cooked tenders to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.

### Step 8: Serve
Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauces while still crispy.

## Pro Tips for Crispy Success

- **Double Coat**: For extra crispiness, coat again in flour and let sit for 5 minutes before frying
- **Oil Temperature**: Too cool and they'll be soggy; too hot and they'll burn outside before cooking inside
- **Don't Crowd**: Work in batches to maintain oil temperature
- **Rest Before Serving**: Let them sit on paper towels to drain and stay crispy

## Serving Ideas

- Serve with honey mustard, ranch, or hot sauce
- Make chicken sandwiches with coleslaw
- Chop and toss into a salad
- Serve with sweet potato fries and coleslaw
- Pack in lunch boxes for the next day

## Storage

Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 375°F oven for 10 minutes to restore crispiness.
