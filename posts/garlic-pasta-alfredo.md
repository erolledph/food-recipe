# Creamy Garlic Pasta Alfredo

This classic Italian pasta dish is elegantly simple yet incredibly satisfying. Silky Alfredo sauce coats tender pasta, creating a luxurious meal that's surprisingly easy to prepare. Perfect for a weeknight dinner or special occasion.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb fettuccine or pappardelle pasta
- 4 oz butter
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish
- Lemon zest (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Cook the Pasta
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.

### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce
While the pasta cooks, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

### Step 3: Sauté Garlic
Add minced garlic to the melted butter and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly until fragrant. Don't let it brown.

### Step 4: Create the Base
Pour in the heavy cream and milk, stirring well to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer.

### Step 5: Add Cheese
Reduce heat to low and slowly add the Parmesan cheese, stirring constantly until completely melted and smooth. The sauce should be creamy and glossy.

### Step 6: Season
Add salt and white pepper to taste. Remember that Parmesan is salty, so taste before adding too much salt.

### Step 7: Combine with Pasta
Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, tossing gently to coat evenly. If the sauce seems too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach desired consistency.

### Step 8: Serve
Transfer to plates and garnish with fresh parsley, additional Parmesan, and lemon zest if desired.

## Chef's Tips

- **Prevent Curdling**: Keep the heat low and avoid boiling the cream
- **Smooth Texture**: Add the Parmesan slowly while stirring for a silky sauce
- **Adjust Consistency**: Pasta water is your secret weapon - it helps the sauce coat better
- **Fresh Ingredients**: Use freshly grated Parmesan, not pre-shredded, for the best texture

## Variations

- Add crispy bacon or prosciutto
- Include sautéed mushrooms or sun-dried tomatoes
- Toss in fresh spinach at the end
- Add grilled chicken breast for protein
