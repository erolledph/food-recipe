# Homemade Margherita Pizza

Nothing beats fresh, homemade pizza with quality ingredients. This classic Margherita pizza features a crispy yet chewy crust, bright tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella, and fresh basil. It's easier to make than you think!

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

### For the Topping
- 3/4 cup tomato sauce (or crushed tomatoes)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 8 oz fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling
- Parmesan cheese (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Dough
In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. In a small cup, mix yeast with warm water and let sit for 5 minutes until foamy.

### Step 2: Mix Dough
Add yeast mixture and olive oil to flour. Stir until a shaggy dough forms. Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

### Step 3: First Rise
Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.

### Step 4: Prepare Sauce
In a small bowl, combine tomato sauce, minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside.

### Step 5: Shape the Pizza
Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat.

Gently stretch the dough into a round shape, about 1/4 inch thick. You can toss it in the air if you're confident!

### Step 6: Add Sauce
Spread sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Don't use too much sauce - less is more.

### Step 7: Add Cheese
Tear mozzarella into pieces and distribute evenly over the sauce. Don't overload - you want the crust to stay crispy.

### Step 8: Bake
Carefully transfer pizza to the hot pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.

### Step 9: Finish
Remove from oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and a pinch of Parmesan if desired.

### Step 10: Slice and Serve
Let cool for 2 minutes, slice, and serve immediately.

## Tips for Perfect Pizza

- **Temperature is Key**: A preheated pizza stone makes a huge difference in achieving a crispy crust
- **Don't Overload**: A light hand with toppings allows the crust to crisp properly
- **Fresh Ingredients**: Use the best tomatoes and mozzarella you can find
- **Timing**: From dough to table should be quick - don't let it sit too long before baking

## Variations

- **Bianca**: Omit tomato sauce, use ricotta and mozzarella
- **Vegetarian**: Add roasted vegetables like zucchini, mushrooms, or bell peppers
- **Meat Lovers**: Top with prosciutto after baking for a lighter touch
- **Spicy**: Add red pepper flakes to the sauce

## Storage

Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator for 2 days. Reheat in a 400°F oven for 5-7 minutes to restore crispiness.
