# Quinoa Buddha Bowl with Tahini Dressing

This vibrant Buddha bowl is a nutritional powerhouse disguised as a delicious meal. Fluffy quinoa serves as the base for roasted vegetables, crispy chickpeas, and a creamy tahini dressing that ties everything together beautifully.

## Ingredients

### For the Bowl
- 1 cup cooked quinoa
- 2 medium carrots, sliced into rounds
- 1 medium zucchini, sliced into half-moons
- 8 oz cherry tomatoes
- 1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 1/2 avocado, sliced
- 1/4 cup shredded purple cabbage
- 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
- 2 tablespoons hemp seeds

### For the Tahini Dressing
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2-3 tablespoons warm water
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Step 1: Roast the Vegetables
Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Toss carrot rounds and zucchini slices with olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. Add cherry tomatoes for the last 5 minutes.

### Step 2: Prepare Chickpeas
Toss drained chickpeas with olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Add to the baking sheet for the last 10 minutes of roasting until crispy.

### Step 3: Cook Quinoa (if not pre-cooked)
Rinse quinoa thoroughly. Combine 1 cup quinoa with 2 cups water in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes covered, until liquid is absorbed.

### Step 4: Make the Tahini Dressing
In a small bowl, whisk together tahini, lemon juice, and minced garlic. Add warm water gradually while whisking until you reach a pourable consistency.

Stir in maple syrup, salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust water or lemon juice as needed.

### Step 5: Assemble the Bowl
Start with a base of fresh spinach in a large bowl. Add a mound of quinoa in the center.

Arrange roasted vegetables, crispy chickpeas, avocado slices, and shredded cabbage around the quinoa.

### Step 6: Garnish
Top with pumpkin seeds and hemp seeds for extra crunch and nutrition.

### Step 7: Drizzle
Drizzle tahini dressing generously over the bowl, or serve on the side.

### Step 8: Serve
Toss everything together and enjoy immediately!
