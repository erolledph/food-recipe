# Teriyaki Salmon with Sesame Vegetables

This elegant yet simple salmon dish features a glossy teriyaki glaze and crispy sesame-coated vegetables. It's sophisticated enough for dinner guests but easy enough for a weeknight meal.

## Ingredients

### For the Teriyaki Glaze
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons mirin (or honey)
- 1 tablespoon sake (or water)
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon water

### For the Salmon
- 2 salmon fillets (6 oz each)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

### For the Sesame Vegetables
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 8 oz bok choy, cut into thirds
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds (white or black)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Teriyaki Glaze
In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, and brown sugar. Heat over medium until it begins to simmer.

Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Simmer for 2 minutes.

Mix cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water to create a slurry. Stir into the glaze to thicken. Cook for 1 minute until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Set aside and keep warm.

### Step 2: Prepare the Salmon
Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.

Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.

### Step 3: Sear the Salmon
Place salmon skin-side up in the hot skillet. Cook for 4 minutes without moving, until the skin is crispy and releases easily from the pan.

Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until cooked through (internal temperature 145°F).

### Step 4: Glaze the Salmon
Brush the cooked salmon with the teriyaki glaze. Cook for 1 minute more, then transfer to serving plates.

### Step 5: Prepare the Vegetables
While the salmon cooks, bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add broccoli florets and cook for 3 minutes.

Add bok choy and cook for another 2 minutes until tender-crisp. Drain well.

### Step 6: Season the Vegetables
Transfer vegetables to a bowl. Drizzle with sesame oil and soy sauce. Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

Toss gently to coat evenly.

### Step 7: Toast the Sesame Seeds
In a small dry skillet over medium heat, toast sesame seeds for 2-3 minutes, stirring often, until fragrant.

Sprinkle toasted seeds over the vegetables.

### Step 8: Plate and Serve
Arrange sesame vegetables on plates alongside the glazed salmon. Drizzle any remaining teriyaki glaze around the plate.

Garnish with green onions and additional sesame seeds if desired.
