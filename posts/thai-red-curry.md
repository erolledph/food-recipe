# Spicy Thai Red Curry with Chicken

Bring the bold flavors of Thailand to your dinner table with this vibrant red curry. Creamy coconut milk balances the heat from red curry paste, while tender chicken and fresh vegetables create a restaurant-quality meal that's ready in just 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 3-4 tablespoons red curry paste
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 2 bell peppers (red or yellow), sliced
- 8 oz snap peas
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon palm sugar or brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves
- Lime juice to taste
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Step 1: Bloom the Curry Paste
Heat coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add red curry paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant.

### Step 2: Cook the Chicken
Add chicken pieces to the curry paste and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until partially cooked on the outside.

### Step 3: Add Coconut Milk
Pour in the coconut milk slowly, stirring to combine with the curry paste. Break up the coconut solids if using canned coconut milk.

### Step 4: Simmer
Add chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through.

### Step 5: Add Vegetables
Add bell peppers, snap peas, and cherry tomatoes. Simmer for 5 minutes until vegetables are tender-crisp.

### Step 6: Season
Stir in garlic, fish sauce, and sugar. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add salt and pepper to preference.

### Step 7: Finish
Remove from heat and stir in fresh basil and lime juice. Taste and adjust lime juice and fish sauce as desired.

### Step 8: Serve
Ladle into bowls and serve immediately over steamed rice or with rice noodles.
