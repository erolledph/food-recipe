# Creamy Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese

This classic comfort combo never disappoints. A velvety tomato soup paired with a gooey grilled cheese sandwich is pure coziness in a bowl. The best part? It comes together in just 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

### For the Soup
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup vegetable or chicken broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil for garnish
- Croutons for topping

### For the Grilled Cheese
- 4 slices bread (sourdough or white bread)
- 4 slices cheese (cheddar, American, or a mix)
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened

## Instructions

### For the Soup

#### Step 1: Sauté Aromatics
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and translucent.

#### Step 2: Add Garlic
Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Step 3: Add Tomatoes
Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, then add crushed tomatoes and broth.

#### Step 4: Simmer
Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

#### Step 5: Blend Smooth
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth and creamy. Alternatively, carefully transfer to a blender in batches.

#### Step 6: Add Cream
Return soup to low heat (if using a blender). Stir in heavy cream and sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

#### Step 7: Warm Through
Heat gently but don't boil. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

### For the Grilled Cheese

#### Step 1: Prepare
Spread softened butter on one side of each bread slice.

#### Step 2: Build the Sandwich
Place one slice butter-side down in a skillet over medium heat. Top with cheese slices, then the second bread slice butter-side up.

#### Step 3: Cook First Side
Cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and crispy.

#### Step 4: Flip and Cook
Carefully flip and cook the other side for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and cheese is melted.

#### Step 5: Rest
Remove from heat and let cool for 1 minute before cutting (cheese will set slightly).

### To Serve

Ladle soup into bowls, garnish with fresh basil and croutons. Serve grilled cheese alongside for dipping and eating.

## Tips for Success

### For Perfect Soup
- **Fresh Basil**: Add it at the very end for maximum flavor
- **Consistency**: Add more broth if too thick, or simmer longer if too thin
- **Cream Quality**: Use real cream for the best texture
- **Avoid Scorching**: Keep heat low when adding cream

### For Perfect Grilled Cheese
- **Butter Everywhere**: Don't skip buttering the outside of the bread for maximum crispiness
- **Medium Heat**: Too high and the bread burns before cheese melts; too low and it gets soggy
- **Cheese Quality**: Use good melting cheese for best results
- **Timing**: Don't flip too early - wait for a nice golden crust

## Flavor Variations

- **Italian Style**: Add oregano, basil, and balsamic vinegar
- **Spicy**: Add red pepper flakes or a splash of hot sauce
- **Roasted Red Pepper**: Add roasted red peppers and a touch of smokiness
- **Garden Fresh**: Include fresh herbs like thyme or oregano

## Make-Ahead

- **Soup**: Make ahead and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 2 months
- **Reheat**: Warm gently on the stovetop, stirring often
- **Grilled Cheese**: Make fresh just before serving
